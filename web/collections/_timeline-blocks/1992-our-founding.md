description: Barry Scheck (right) and Peter Neufeld (left) first met as public defenders at Bronx Legal Aid Society. The two realized the significance of DNA technology after learning of DNA methods through their work with students on the case of Marion Coakley. Soon, a small group of lawyers, students, and volunteers took on cases to free wrongfully convicted people through DNA testing at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.
