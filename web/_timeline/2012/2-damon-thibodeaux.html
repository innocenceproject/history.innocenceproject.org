          Damon Thibodeaux (pictured center) was wrongfully convicted based on an eyewitness misidentification and a
          false confession. Following his exoneration, he told a TV station that "[the] best part of my day, no matter
          how good the rest of my day is, is when I wake up every morning and I don't see those bars." (Image: Calhoun
