          During the process of post-conviction DNA litigation, Michael Morton's attorneys obtained documents proving
          his innocence that prosecutor Ken Anderson had withheld at trial. The Texas Supreme Court ordered a Court of
          Inquiry that later determined that there was probable cause to believe that Mr. Anderson had violated criminal
          laws by hiding evidence.
