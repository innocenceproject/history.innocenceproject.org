        <div class="timeline-subheader reveal">The National Academy of Sciences issues a report calling for a
          comprehensive reform of forensic sciences and increased forensic oversight. The report additionally recommends
          the creation of an independent, science-based federal entity that would oversee research and evaluation in the
          forensic sciences, establish scientifically validated standards, and ensure that those standards are applied
          consistently across the U.S.</div>
