          In 2013, the DOJ and FBI announced that they would collaborate with the Innocence Project and NACDL on a
          comprehensive review of criminal cases in which FBI Laboratory and testimony included statements made by FBI
          examiners that were scientifically invalid. The review found that 26 out of 28 FBI examiners had submitted
          testimony or reports with an erroneous statement. Six years later, in 2019, the FBI published a root cause
          analysis of how errors in reporting and testimony of microscopic hair comparison analysis persisted through
          the years.
