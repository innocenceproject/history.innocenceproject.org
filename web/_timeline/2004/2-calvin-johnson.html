          Calvin Johnson (pictured on the left) was wrongly convicted of a sexual assault and robbery based on
          eyewitness misidentification and flawed serology. He spent 16 years in prison before the Innocence Project
          secured DNA testing that proved his innocence. Since his exoneration in 1999, Mr. Johnson has published a
          book, Exit to Freedom, and served on the board of the Georgia Innocence Project.
