        <div class="timeline-subheader reveal">The National Academy of Sciences issues an important report evaluating
          scientific research on memory and eyewitness identification. The report recommends several best practices
          endorsed by the Innocence Project, including a blind administration of photos and live lineups during police
          eyewitness identification procedures, securing confidence statements from eyewitnesses immediately after
          they've looked at lineups, and more.</div>
