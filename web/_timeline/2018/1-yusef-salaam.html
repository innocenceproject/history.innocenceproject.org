          Yusef Salaam (pictured center below), along with four other Black and brown teenagers, was wrongly convicted
          in a case that was rife with a racialized presumption of dangerousness and underscored racial bias within the
          U.S. criminal legal system. Mr. Salaam has since leveraged his platform to continue advocating for criminal
          justice reform and prison reform that would especially address the criminal justice system's disparate
          treatment of Black and brown youth. (Image: Elijah Craig/Innocence Project)
