header: Death-Row Exonerations and a Moratorium on the Death Penalty

subheader: A series of death-row exonerations in Illinois prompts the convening of the National Conference on Wrongful Convictions and the Death Penalty at Northwestern University School of Law. The conference, along with subsequent death-row exonerations that include that of Innocence Project client Ronald Jones, help propel the effort to get a successful moratorium on the death penalty in the state — the nation’s first.

description: In 1989, Ronald Jones was wrongly convicted of rape and murder largely based on eyewitness misidentification, a false confession, and the misapplication of forensic science. Following his conviction, a judge sentenced him to death.
