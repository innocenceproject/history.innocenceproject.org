header: Facial Recognition in Maryland

subheader: Maryland passes a law regulating how law enforcement can use facial recognition technology. Prosecutors must now tell the court whenever facial recognition is used in a criminal or juvenile case, and police agencies using the technology must complete regular audits to ensure compliance. The law also makes clear that no one can be arrested or identified based solely on facial recognition without additional evidence.
