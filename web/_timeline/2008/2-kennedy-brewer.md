header: Exonerations in Mississippi

subheader: The Innocence Project secures the exoneration of Kennedy Brewer, who was sentenced to death based on invalid bite mark comparison evidence. DNA testing identified the actual person who committed the crime, which led to the exonerations of both Mr. Brewer and Levon Brooks, the latter of whom had been serving a life sentence for a related murder and was also represented by the Mississippi Innocence Project.
